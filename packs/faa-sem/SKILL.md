# FAA Systems Engineering Manual (SEM) v1.0.1
**Source**: FAA — US Government work, public domain | **Chapters**: 7

## How to Use This Skill
- **Without arguments** — load the Core Frameworks below for the AMS lifecycle backbone, the front-end concept/functional/requirements/architecture flow, the seven technical management disciplines, and the specialty disciplines.
- **With a topic** — ask about an AMS phase or decision point, a front-end process (ConOps, functional analysis, FFBD/N², CMLs), requirements (PRS→MRS, the pPRD→iPRD→fPRD ratchet, CPRs, VRTM), architecture (RAM, ISEF/DoDAF views, the design vs. requirements loops), a technical-management discipline (SEMP, interfaces/IRD-ICD, RIO risk, CM/baselines, SEIM, decision analysis, V&V), or a specialty (RMA/Service Threads, LCE/ILS, E3/Spectrum, Human Factors, Information Security/RMF, System Safety/SMS, environmental/EOSH).
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch01` (intro & AMS lifecycle), `ch02` (concept & functional analysis), `ch03` (requirements, architecture, M&S), `ch04` (technical management, interfaces, risk), `ch05` (CM, SEIM, decision analysis, V&V), `ch06` (RMA, LCE, E3/Spectrum, HFE), `ch07` (infosec, safety, environmental).

**Prerequisites:** none — plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier needed at runtime.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### The AMS Lifecycle — the spine of the whole manual
The FAA wraps SE around its **Acquisition Management System (AMS)**: five phases punctuated by five numbered decision points. A solution begins as an identified *service need*, matures through analysis and development, and ends as a fielded capability sustained until replaced or retired.

1. **Service Analysis & Strategic Planning** → (1) Concept & Requirements Definition Readiness Decision
2. **Concept and Requirements Definition (CRD)** → (2) Investment Analysis Readiness Decision
3. **Investment Analysis (Initial → Final IA)** → (3) Initial Investment Decision · (4) Final Investment Decision
4. **Solution Implementation** (Product Realization → Deployment & Transition) → (5) In-Service Decision
5. **In-Service Management** (operational analysis feeds shortfalls back to the front)

Two altitudes run throughout: the **enterprise level** (integration across investment programs, EA roadmaps, portfolio alignment) and the **program level** (optimizing one solution). SE is a **distributed skill set**, not a job title — the "Systems Engineering Role" describes a function being performed, whoever holds the badge.

### The maturity ratchet
Each phase raises the resolution of the same few things — the need, the requirements, the alternatives, the cost estimate, the safety picture. **Requirements maturity is the program's pulse**: pPR/pPRD → iPR/iPRD → fPR/fPRD → system specifications, kept in lockstep with the contracts track (SIRs, Statements of Work) and the enterprise architecture. An approved **fPRD with an 80%-stable set** gates the Final Investment Decision.

### Front end: keep "what for / what / how" separate
- **Operational Concept Development** fixes *what the solution is for and how it will be used* → a vetted **ConOps** plus preliminary shortfall, benefit, safety, and risk analyses. **Concept Maturity Levels (CML 1–4)** give a shared maturity vocabulary that drives funding and research priorities.
- **Functional Analysis** fixes *what it does* — implementation-free. **Functions are never allocated**; you convert function → **PRS → MRS** (requirement), and the *requirement* is allocated to the physical architecture. A complete functional model needs **both** the **FFBD** (control/sequencing) and the **N²** (data/interfaces). Output: the seven-part **Functional Architecture Document (FAD)**.
- **Physical architecture** answers *how* — deferred until the problem is understood.

### Requirements & architecture (SEM 3.3–3.5)
- **Requirements Analysis = Development + Management.** Author with `shall`/`will`/`may` (never `should`, never `and/or`); every requirement carries a verification method (Inspection/Analysis/Demonstration/Test) rolled into the **VRTM**. **CPRs** are the minimal make-or-break performance requirements, copied verbatim into the **APB**.
- **Architectural Design Synthesis** develops alternatives, allocates requirements via the **RAM**, and evaluates alternatives on cost/schedule/performance/risk. Read the *pattern* of failure: **all alternatives fail the same requirements → design loop** (back to functions); **compliance varies → requirements feedback loop**.
- **Modeling, simulation & prototyping** buy down risk before fielding; match fidelity to value-of-information.

### The seven technical management disciplines (over a mandatory QMS)
Integrated Technical Management · Interface Management · Risk Management (RIO) · Configuration Management · SE Information Management · Decision Analysis · Verification and Validation.
- **ITM = plan + control:** SEMP (Program + Contractor variants) → ISPD → Life Cycle Plan, then monitor via TPM/CPR/EVM and control via reviews and audits (`TRA·SRR·SDR·SSR·PDR·CDR·TRR·ISR·FCA·PCA·PRR`).
- **Interfaces:** the **ICD complies with the IRD complies with the fPRD**; change runs the other way (ICR → IWG → CM).
- **RIO triage by one temporal question** (*has it happened yet?*): future-negative = **Risk**, realized-negative = **Issue** (no likelihood), future-positive = **Opportunity**. Plan strategies: Avoid/Transfer/**Control**/Accept/Research-and-Knowledge; roll up the **maximum** risk through the WBS/IMS.
- **CM** holds the *product* truth (five baselines: Functional/Allocated/Product/Facility/Operational) under CCB control; **SEIM** holds the *project* truth as a PDCA cycle (acquire→validate→maintain→distribute→archive→retire).
- **Decision Analysis** is tool-agnostic — match technique fidelity to decision stakes; DA recommends, the authority decides.
- **V&V:** verification = "built right" (incremental, DT); validation = "right thing" (iterative, early, OT/IOA), anchored in the V model and the VRTM.

### Specialty engineering — front-loaded and wired back in
Cost is front-loaded, pain is back-loaded, so each discipline starts its own closed-loop risk cycle early and routes outputs back into requirements, risk, and V&V.
- **RMA:** allocate dependability by **Service Thread / STLSC** (Essential .9999, Efficiency-Critical .99999, Safety-Critical = two independent .99999 threads), *not* by an availability spec for software-intensive systems; validate via reliability growth with Government-controlled "expunging."
- **Life Cycle Engineering / ILS:** early decisions lock in most lifetime cost (support can exceed 70% of operations budget); favor technology insertion over wholesale replacement.
- **E3 / Spectrum:** EMC is a bidirectional relationship, not a property; FCC compliance is necessary but not sufficient. Spectrum is a scarce governed resource — no RF system fields without an assignment.
- **Human Factors:** operators and maintainers are first-class system elements (Human Performance Interfaces taxonomy + 24 Areas of Interest).
- **Information Security:** categorize-then-tailor under FIPS 199/200 and the **NIST RMF**; the FAA Security Authorization (FAA Order 1370.82A) accepts residual risk via POA&Ms toward ongoing authorization.
- **System Safety:** the **SMS** five-phase SRM loop and the OSA→CSA→PHA→SSHA→SHA→O&SHA→SSAR analysis ladder.
- **HMM/EE/EOSH:** bidirectional, cradle-to-grave compliance (CAA, CWA, NEPA, RCRA, OSHA) folded into the APB.

## Scope & Limits

**Covers**: civil-agency systems engineering as the FAA's Systems Engineering Manual v1.0.1 institutionalizes it inside the Acquisition Management System and the National Airspace System — the five-phase AMS lifecycle and decision points; operational concept development and implementation-free functional analysis; requirements analysis and architectural design synthesis (PRS→MRS, the PRD ratchet, RAM, ISEF/DoDAF views, CPRs, VRTM); the seven technical management disciplines (ITM/SEMP, Interface Management, Risk-Issue-Opportunity, Configuration Management, SEIM, Decision Analysis, V&V); and the specialty disciplines (RMA via Service Threads, Life Cycle Engineering/ILS, E3/Spectrum, Human Factors, Information Security via the NIST RMF, System Safety via the SMS, and Hazardous Materials/Environmental/EOSH).

**Does not cover in depth** (where the source is thin or points elsewhere): the SEM is a **pointer document** — RMA detail lives in the FAA RMA Handbook (FAA-HDBK-006A), safety method detail in the SMS Manual and SRMGSA, and information-security control detail in the NIST 800-series; use those for discipline depth. The manual is **guidance, not policy** (binding policy is the AMS itself, via FAST). It does **not** develop generic SE theory (read the NASA SE Handbook, the DAU SE Guidebook, the SEBoK, or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 for that); it is thin on detailed cost estimating and earned-value mechanics, contracting/FAR-DFARS law, software-development methodology, and a labeled catalogue of named anti-patterns (it gives positive guidance with scattered cautions). It does not address non-FAA, non-civil-aviation, or international lifecycles except where it maps to ISO 15288 and DoDAF.

**Jurisdiction & version**: FAA Systems Engineering Manual, **Version 1.0.1 (2014-06-19)** — US Government work, public domain. The extracted source text carries no page numbering (estimated ~360 pp.). Applies to FAA acquisitions affecting the NAS; other organisations may adopt the framework voluntarily. Replaces the 2006 NAS SEM v3.1.
