description: "Knowledge base from the DOE Order on Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets (DOE O 413.3 series). Use for Critical Decisions CD-0–CD-4, performance baselines, acquisition strategy and IPTs, cost/schedule/EVMS/PARS controls, risk-informed governance, reviews, and contractor requirements. Built from O 413.3C (2026-08-05), which cancels O 413.3B Chg 7 (2023-06-21); does not replace site-specific procedures, nuclear safety rules detail, or full estimating standards."

# DOE Capital Asset Project Management (O 413.3 series)
**Source**: DOE O 413.3C (2026-08-05; cancels O 413.3B Chg 7) (US Government work, public domain) | **Chapters**: 6

## When to use
Reach for this pack when planning, governing, or reviewing DOE/NNSA capital asset projects under the 413.3 Order family — mission need through completion, Critical Decision gates, performance baselines, acquisition strategy and IPTs, EVMS/PARS reporting, risk-informed approvals, exemptions, and contractor requirements flow-down.

**Prerequisites:** none — plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier needed at runtime.

## How to Use This Skill
- **Without arguments** — load the core frameworks below.
- **With a topic** — ask about CD-0–CD-4, PB, EVMS, IPT, PARS, risk, exemptions, or CRD.
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch01` through `ch06`.

Supporting files: `glossary.md`, `patterns.md`, `cheatsheet.md`.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### What the Order is
Risk-informed direction for acquiring capital assets so projects meet the original performance baseline and mission/ES&H/security performance unless a directed change intervenes — aligned with OMB capital-programming expectations.

### Critical Decision spine
CD-0 mission need → CD-1 alternative and cost range → CD-2 performance baseline → CD-3 execution/construction start → CD-4 operations/completion.

### Control triad after CD-2
| Control | Role |
|---------|------|
| Performance baseline | Commitment snapshot (scope/cost/schedule) |
| Change control | Authorized evolution of the baseline |
| EVMS + PARS | Performance measurement and Department visibility |

### Governance web
Line management owns outcomes; PSO/PMSO/PM/FPD/IPT and approval authorities form the decision system; CRD carries requirements to contractors; reviews provide independent signal.

## Scope & Limits
This pack covers the DOE Order on Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets using the **consolidated current Order PDF at build time: DOE O 413.3C (approved 2026-08-05)**, which cancels **DOE O 413.3B Chg 7 (2023-06-21)**. Extract metadata **source_pages=132**. Pack slug `doe-413-3b` retains T1-06 roadmap identity. It does **not** replace site implementing procedures, full text of companion G 413.3 guides, nuclear safety rule detail (e.g., 10 CFR 830), or GAO-grade estimating standards. In-PDF third-party copyright check at build found no copyright notices. US Government public domain work. No source-material download link is published.
