description: "Knowledge base from the DoD M&S VV&A Recommended Practices Guide (RPG web edition). Use for verification, validation, and accreditation of models and simulations — role responsibilities (user, developer, M&S PM, V&V agent, accreditation agent), fidelity, validation fundamentals, data V&V, and risk-informed accreditation decisions. Complements nasa-ms-7009 and T&E packs; does not replace DoDI 5000.61 or Service VV&A policies."

# DoD M&S VV&A Recommended Practices Guide (RPG)
**Source**: DoD VV&A RPG web edition (US Government work, public domain) | **Chapters**: 10

## When to use
Reach for this pack when planning or reviewing **Verification, Validation, and Accreditation (VV&A)** for defense modeling and simulation — assigning role responsibilities, scoping V&V to intended use, setting fidelity/referent expectations, validating results or data, or framing accreditation risk and residual uncertainty for decision authorities.

**Prerequisites:** none — plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier needed at runtime.

## How to Use This Skill
- **Without arguments** — load the core frameworks below.
- **With a topic** — ask about accreditation, intended use, referent, fidelity, data V&V, residual risk, or a named role.
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch01` through `ch10`.

Supporting files: `glossary.md`, `patterns.md`, `cheatsheet.md`.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### VV&A triad
| Element | Question | Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Verification | Did we build the M&S right? | Evidence the implementation matches the conceptual model / specs |
| Validation | Did we build the right M&S? | Evidence of adequate accuracy vs the referent for intended use |
| Accreditation | Is it acceptable for this use? | Official determination by the Accreditation Authority |

### Intended use first
All V&V scope, fidelity, data pedigree, and accreditation criteria flow from a clear **intended use** statement. Vague use → unscoped V&V and non-defensible accreditation.

### Role set (new development)
User · Developer · M&S Program Manager · V&V Agent · Accreditation Agent — each owns distinct products and acceptance points; collapsing roles without independence controls weakens credibility.

### Referent and fidelity
Validation compares M&S behavior to a **referent** (reality, data, higher-fidelity model, or SME consensus) at the fidelity needed for the decision — not maximum fidelity everywhere.

### Risk couples to accreditation
Accepting incorrect M&S results (Type II) usually dominates. Residual risk after V&V must be explicit in the accreditation recommendation.

### Pack routing
- **nasa-ms-7009** — NASA models & simulations standard/handbook depth.
- **dote-te-guidebook / dod-te-guidebook** — enterprise T&E; use when M&S supports DT/OT evidence.
- **This pack** — DoD VV&A RPG role practices, validation fundamentals, data V&V, risk.

- [patterns.md](patterns.md) — recurring practice patterns
- [cheatsheet.md](cheatsheet.md) — quick decision rules

## Scope & Limits
- Synthesized from selected **new-development** role guides plus fidelity, validation, data V&V, and risk special topics of the DoD VV&A RPG web edition (retrieved 2026-08-16). Not a substitute for DoDI 5000.61, Service regs, or program accreditation authority direction.
- Legacy-simulation role guides and the T&E/V&V Checklist PDF were not packaged (selection); principles may still appear where the selected chapters discuss them.
- Does not reproduce long source passages; use official publications for citation in contracts or formal accreditation records.
