description: "Knowledge base from DAFMAN 63-119 (15 April 2021), Mission-Oriented Test Readiness Certification. Use for continuous MOTRC replacing single-point OTRR thinking: framework/applicability, Certification Official vs PM roles, review cycle and exit criteria, certification memo/decertify gates, DT&E/contractor evidence, ITT integration and cyber resiliency, and the 31-template matrix. DAF T&E readiness process only—does not replace DoDI 5000.89, AFI 99-103, or multi-service lead policies."

# DAFMAN 63-119 — Mission-Oriented Test Readiness Certification
**Source**: DAFMAN 63-119, 15 April 2021 (US Government work, public domain; no releasability restrictions) | **Chapters**: 7

## When to use
Use this pack when planning or running **Mission-Oriented Test Readiness Certification** for DAF (USAF/USSF) programs—standing up the continuous process that replaced OTRR-centric thinking, assigning the Certification Official, driving template-based reviews, writing the certification memorandum, treating DT/contractor/integrated-test evidence, and folding cyber resiliency and industry/supplier test obligations into OT readiness.

**Prerequisites:** none — plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier needed at runtime. Pair with `dote-te-guidebook` / `dod-te-guidebook` for enterprise T&E context and DoDI 5000.89 framing.

## How to Use This Skill
- **Without arguments** — load the core frameworks below.
- **With a topic** — ask about MOTRC vs OTRR, Certification Official rules, review cycles, memos, DT sufficiency, contractor testing, ITT integration, cyber, or templates.
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch01` through `ch07`.

Supporting files: `glossary.md`, `patterns.md`, `cheatsheet.md`.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### Continuous MOTRC (not a single OTRR)
DAF replaced OTRR-as-the-main-event with a **continuous** mission-oriented certification process from early development through dedicated OT, backed by 31 templates (Attachments 2–32) and mandatory through testing to operational acceptance.

### Certification Official independence
| Program type | Typical Certification Official | PM may self-certify? |
|--------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| ACAT I MDAP | SAF/AQ (MDA) or delegated PEO | No |
| ACAT II / OSD oversight | PEO (as assigned) | No |
| Others | As designated in TEMP/strategy | Follow designation; still separate judgment |

### Review cycle loop
Pre-cert reviews → candid assessment vs exit criteria → negotiate workarounds/limits → report (DT report + executive brief) → **memo** → OTO acknowledge → (optional) decertify/recertify.

### Evidence triangle
1. **DT & contractor test** sufficiency and representativeness  
2. **Integrated test** data with argued OT credit  
3. **OT plan** entrance/exit criteria and resources  

### Template matrix (three groups)
- Planning & documentation (strategy, requirements, TEMP, ITT, …)
- Design & performance (cyber, CT, DT, software, CM, deficiencies, OT plan, …)
- Assets & support (training, SE, spares, agreements, PHS&T, personnel, tech data, T&E resources)

### Integration & supplier lens
ITT co-chairs (CDT/TM + OTO) orchestrate; contractor/supplier data rights and test support are certification inputs, not optional annexes.
