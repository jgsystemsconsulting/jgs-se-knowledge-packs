description: "Knowledge base from the NASA Systems Engineering Handbook (NASA/SP-2016-6105 Rev 2). Use for NASA's systems-engineering process model — the SE Engine and 17 common technical processes, the program/project life cycle (Pre-Phase A through F), Key Decision Points and technical reviews (MCR/SRR/PDR/CDR/…), stakeholder expectations, technical requirements, design solution, product verification and validation, and crosscutting technical management (planning, risk, configuration, interfaces, data, assessment, decision analysis).

# NASA Systems Engineering Handbook
**Source**: NASA (US Government work, public domain) | **Document**: NASA/SP-2016-6105 Rev 2 | **Pages**: ~383 | **Chapters**: 34

## When to use

Use this pack when you need NASA's systems-engineering process model: the **SE Engine** and the **17 common technical processes**, the **program/project life cycle** (Pre-Phase A → F), **Key Decision Points** and **technical reviews** (MCR, SRR, SDR, PDR, CDR, SAR, ORR, FRR), stakeholder expectations → technical requirements → logical decomposition → design solution, product verification vs validation, and crosscutting technical management (planning, risk, configuration, interfaces, data, assessment, decision analysis). Strong for aerospace/spaceflight project SE and lifecycle gating. Less suited to general MBSE notation or AI integration.

**Prerequisites:** none — this pack is plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier is needed at runtime.

## How to Use This Skill

- **Without arguments** — load the core process model below for reference.
- **With a topic** — ask about `verification vs validation`, `PDR`, `trade studies`, `configuration management`, or another indexed topic; I read the relevant chapter.
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch20` to load Design Solution Definition.
- **Browse** — ask "what chapters do you have?" for the full index.

Supporting files: `glossary.md` (108 terms), `patterns.md` (20 techniques), `cheatsheet.md` (decision rules, phase/KDP/review gates, cost thresholds).

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

**The SE Engine (Ch 1–3).** NASA's central model: the 17 common technical processes arranged as three families — **system design** (4 processes: stakeholder expectations, technical requirements, logical decomposition, design solution), **product realization** (5: implementation, integration, verification, validation, transition), and **technical management** (8: planning, requirements management, interface management, risk, configuration, data, assessment, decision analysis). The engine is applied **recursively** down the product hierarchy and **iteratively** within each life-cycle phase.

**Program/project life cycle (Ch 7–16).** Phases **Pre-Phase A** (concept studies) → **A** (concept & technology development) → **B** (preliminary design) → **C** (final design & fabrication) → **D** (assembly, integration, test, launch) → **E** (operations) → **F** (closeout). Phase transitions are gated at **Key Decision Points (KDPs)** and supported by **technical reviews** (MCR, SRR, SDR/MDR, PDR, CDR, SIR, TRR, SAR, ORR, FRR).

**System design flow (Ch 17–20).** **Stakeholder Expectations** (captured as Needs-Goals-Objectives, ConOps, and Measures of Effectiveness) → **Technical Requirements** (validated, verifiable, with MOPs/TPMs) → **Logical Decomposition** (functional architecture, Product Breakdown Structure) → **Design Solution** (trade studies + decision analysis selecting the baseline).

**Product realization (Ch 21–25).** Implementation (make/buy/reuse) → Integration → **Verification** ("built it right" — test, analysis, inspection, demonstration) → **Validation** ("built the right thing" — against stakeholder expectations) → Transition. Verification and validation are distinct and both required.

**Crosscutting technical management (Ch 26–34).** Technical Planning (WBS, SEMP), Requirements Management (traceability, change control), Interface Management, **Technical Risk Management** (continuous, risk-informed decision making), Configuration Management, Technical Data Management, **Technical Assessment** (TPMs, EVM, reviews), and **Decision Analysis** (structured trade studies).

## Scope & Limits

This pack covers NASA/SP-2016-6105 Rev 2 only. It is **NASA-specific**: the process model, Key Decision Points, technical reviews, and tailoring are framed for NASA programs/projects (and reference NPR 7123.1), with an aerospace/spaceflight emphasis. It is strong for lifecycle process, gating, V&V, and technical management; it is **not** a modelling-notation reference (use the SysML pack) and does not address AI/ML integration. The source is a US Government work in the public domain.
