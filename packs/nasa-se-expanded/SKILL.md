# Expanded Guidance for NASA Systems Engineering (NASA/SP-2016-6105-SUPPL, Vol 1, March 2016)
**Source**: NASA — US Government work, public domain | **Chapters**: 6 | **Role**: depth supplement to `nasa-se-handbook`

## How to Use This Skill
This pack is the **expanded-guidance depth layer** over the base `nasa-se-handbook`. It assumes you already know the standard definitions (the 17 processes, ConOps, MOEs, the V&V split, PBS/WBS, the risk triplet) and instead supplies the *operating mechanics* — the procedures, the cardinality patterns, the decision trees, and the named pitfalls the handbook compresses to a sentence. For survey-level orientation, read the handbook pack first; come here for "how does this actually run, and what goes wrong."

- **Without arguments** — load the core frameworks below for the SE Engine cadence, the tailoring machinery, the system-design loop, the realization cardinality clocks, and the crosscutting-management toolkit.
- **With a topic** — ask about a specific mechanic: "iterative vs. recursive", "tailoring vs. customization", "ConOps vs. Operations Concept", "verify/qualify/accept/certify", "protoflight", "six-step scheduling", "JCL scatterplot", "IRD vs. ICD vs. IDD", "RIDM vs. CRM", "the four CM baselines", "EVM SPI/CPI", "MOE/MOP/KPP/TPM", "the three required leading indicators", "AHP vs. Borda vs. MAUT".
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch01` (SE engine fundamentals), `ch02` (life cycle & tailoring), `ch03` (system design processes), `ch04` (product realization), `ch05` (planning/requirements/interface/risk management), `ch06` (CM/data/assessment/decision analysis).

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### The SE Engine read correctly (NPR 7123.1)
The 17 processes sit in three sets — **system design** (4), **product realization** (5), **technical management** (8). The load-bearing reading the handbook blurs: processes **10–17 are crosscutting *tools*** for executing 1–9, not the next sequential steps. The engine is a **template you stamp onto every product** in the hierarchy — each tier "resets to process 1" and runs its own full pass with stakeholders inherited from above. Re-run cadence is specific: development processes (1–9) fire **five engine cycles** (Pre-Phase A → D); management processes (10–17) fire **seven** (Pre-Phase A → F). **Phases C and D are split** so design (left side) runs in C and realization (right side) in D. **Implementation fires only at the bottom tier**; every higher pass is **Integration**, and integration-level V&V is non-negotiable because parts passing does not imply the whole passes.

### Iterative vs. recursive (precise defined terms)
**Iterate** = re-run a process on the **same** product to fix a discrepancy. **Recurse** = re-apply the processes to design the **next lower** layer, realize the **next upper** layer, or advance a **life-cycle phase**. Iterate to *fix*; recurse to *descend, ascend, or advance*. The **SE/PP&C overlap** is structural: the systems engineer supplies technical truth and cost/schedule *realism*; Project Planning & Control imposes programmatic constraints. The **AS9100 crosswalk** (Table 2.1-1) maps the 17 processes onto the aerospace quality standard — the bridge for any AS9100-certified Center or contractor.

### The life cycle as a tailoring substrate
The phases/KDPs are a **scaffold right-sized per project**, not a fixed pipeline. **Tailoring** seeks relief from a "shall" (consistent with objectives, allowable risk, constraints) and produces **deviations/waivers** logged in the **Compliance Matrix** (Appendix H.1/OCE for Center-wide, H.2/Center Director for program/project). **Customization** reshapes *how* you meet a requirement and needs **no** waiver. Anchor relief in a risk class (NPR 8705.4) and the eight tailoring characteristics; check the governing PM directive (7120.5/.7/.8, 7150.2) separately. The **SE Product Maturity table** is a Preliminary→Baseline→Update ratchet; `**` cells mark required products per review. The **budget cycle (PPBE)** is a planned *disturbance* — an implicit fiscal gate often slipping past Oct 1 into a continuing resolution — not an SE process.

### The recursive system-design loop
The four design processes are **one consistency clamp**, not a pipeline: a strawman architecture, its ConOps, and the derived requirements are forced into mutual agreement and validated against three questions (works as expected? achievable in budget/schedule? delivers the funded functionality?). Stop refining a branch when it would convince an independent review team the design is feasible — a **resolution** criterion. Distinguish **ConOps** (early, technical-team) from **Operations Concept** (later, flight/ground reasonableness). Route every requirement by **flow, type, and ownership** — programmatic requirements (and waivers) belong to the program/project; technical requirements to the Technical Authority. **Successive refinement**: each turn's allocated/derived requirements become the next level's high-level requirements. Space-asset protection is **survivability engineering** (threat × susceptibility = vulnerability), not security paperwork.

### Product realization — the cardinality clocks
Verification = "built right" (traces to requirements). Validation = "right thing built" (traces to the ConOps). Keep them apart, then exploit overlap where one rig answers both. Sort by clock: **verify / qualify / certify once per design; accept once per unit** — and **certification is an audit of evidence, not a test**. **Protoflight** qualifies on the flight unit itself (reduced margin) instead of dedicated qual hardware. **"Test the way we fly"** is a coverage discipline: prioritized fault-space without combinatorial blowup, skeleton-first with stubs/simulators, a **fresh-eyes operator**, regression after every fix, an authenticated environment, external-interface scope. **Integration engineers interactions, not assemblies** (mechanical/fluid/thermal/electrical/data/logical/human flows), from concept through de-integration. **Transition has two forms** — up (to the next integration level) or out (to the operational user) — and drives packaging, handling, storage, training, and enabling-product handoff. Reused-product **pedigree does not transfer**.

### Crosscutting technical management — the procedures
**Planning** reconciles the team's bottom-up estimate against the project's top-down allocation; build network schedules in **six steps** (negotiate external dependencies, write every basis of estimate, integrate to find the project critical path, resource-level, reserve float). Match **cost-estimating method to maturity** (parametric → analogous → grassroots); read the **JCL** off a cost-vs-schedule Monte Carlo scatterplot (required at KDP C above $250M). **50–70% of life-cycle cost is committed at architecture selection, ~90% by preliminary design.** Assess every requirement change with three tools (performance margins, evaluators list, risk/threats list). **Interface documents**: IRD ("shall", bilateral) → ICD (design solution) or IDD (one-sided), wrapped by an ICP, changed via PIRN/IRN. **Risk = RIDM + CRM**, built from initiating events. **CM**: four baselines map one-to-one to gates (**Functional→SDR, Allocated→PDR, Product→CDR, As-Deployed→ORR**) and rides on **SAE/EIA-649-2** (5 functions, 37 principles); CM needs a CR+CCB, **Technical Data Management** needs only managed change authority. **EVM** measures "the system that produces the system" — earned value (BCWP) is the pivot; planned-vs-actual is spending only. Keep the **MOE/MOP/KPP/TPM** hierarchy straight (customer vs. supplier viewpoint), report the **three required leading indicators** (mass margin, power margin, RFA/RID/action-item burndown) for maturity *and* stability, and pick decision-analysis tools from the catalog (trade studies, cost-benefit, influence diagrams, decision trees, **AHP**, **Borda counting**, **utility/MAUT**) scaling rigour to consequence.

## Scope & Limits

**Covers**: the practitioner-depth supplement to the NASA SE process — the SE Engine's structure and per-phase cadence, the iterative/recursive distinction, the AS9100 crosswalk; life-cycle tailoring vs. customization and the Compliance Matrix governance; the recursive system-design consistency loop (ConOps/Operations-Concept, requirement flow/type/ownership, successive refinement, survivability engineering); product realization (verify/qualify/accept/certify cardinality, protoflight, end-to-end coverage, two-form transition); and the eight crosscutting technical-management processes' operating procedures (six-step scheduling, cost-estimating method selection, JCL, WBS/EVM, interface document family, RIDM/CRM, CM baselines and standards, EVM arithmetic, the MOE/MOP/KPP/TPM hierarchy, the three required leading indicators, and the decision-analysis method catalog).

**Does not cover (by design — it is the depth layer)**: the base survey-level definitions and process input/activity/output tables — those live in the **`nasa-se-handbook`** pack, which this supplement assumes and deliberately does not restate. **Read the two packs together.**

**Thin or absent**: the Volume 2 detailed process-appendix material (entrance/exit criteria checklists, full templates, worked appendices) — this pack is built from **Volume 1 (Systems Engineering Practices)**; the binding "shall" statements (they live in **NPR 7123.1**, with program/project management requirements in **NPR 7120.5/.7/.8** and software in **NPR 7150.2** — this is *guidance*, not the NPR); detailed cost-model construction and contracting/FAR detail; software-engineering methodology; and **non-NASA, commercial, or non-space-flight life cycles** (the framing is NASA space-flight practice). For the wider SE canon and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 lineage see the `sebok` pack.

**Source version**: NASA/SP-2016-6105-SUPPL (March 2016), *Expanded Guidance for NASA Systems Engineering* — **Volume 1**, subtitled *Systems Engineering Practices* (~383 source pages). A NASA work in the US Government public domain.
