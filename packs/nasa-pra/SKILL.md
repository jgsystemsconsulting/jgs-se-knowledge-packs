description: "Knowledge base from the NASA Probabilistic Risk Assessment Procedures Guide (NASA/SP-2011-3421, 2nd ed.). Use for quantitative PRA of aerospace and safety-critical systems: the risk triplet and scenario logic stack (MLD, ESD, event trees, fault trees, minimal cut sets), Bayesian data collection and parameter estimation, aleatory/epistemic uncertainty modeling and common-cause failure (Alpha Factor, beta-factor, CCBE), human reliability analysis (THERP, CREAM, NARA, SPAR-H), context-based software risk (CSRM), physics-based and structural/phenomenological models (stress-strength, limit states, FORM/SORM, NASGRO, range safety), uncertainty propagation and importance measures (F-V, RAW, Birnbaum, DIM), and launch-abort modeling with worked PRA examples. This is the QUANTITATIVE engine beneath NASA's risk doctrine — for the qualitative RIDM/CRM decision framework use the nasa-risk pack. Thin on programme management, organisational risk governance, and non-aerospace regulatory contexts; aerospace-focused and anchored to the 2011 second edition."

# NASA PRA Procedures Guide (NASA/SP-2011-3421, 2nd ed.)
**Source**: NASA (US Government work, public domain) | **Chapters**: 8

## How to Use This Skill
- **Without arguments** — load the core frameworks below; they are the working toolkit, not a summary.
- **With a topic** — ask about fault trees, Bayesian updating, common-cause failure, human error probabilities, software risk, stress-strength models, uncertainty propagation, importance measures, or launch abort; the relevant chapter is read on demand.
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch03` (data + Bayesian estimation) or `ch08` (launch abort + worked examples).
- **Supporting files** — `glossary.md` (terms), `patterns.md` (named techniques with trade-offs), `cheatsheet.md` (selection tables, tells & smells).

**Prerequisites:** none — plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier needed at runtime.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### The Risk Triplet (Kaplan & Garrick)
PRA represents risk as a set of triplets — **scenario, likelihood, consequence** — answering *what can go wrong, how likely is it, what are the consequences*, each with uncertainty made explicit. A single expected-value summary is rejected because prevention requires understanding the *elements* of each adverse scenario. A scenario's frequency is the initiating-event frequency times the conditional probability of reaching its end state.

### The Scenario Logic Stack
Risk is decomposed through a chain of graphical Boolean models:
- **Master Logic Diagram (MLD)** — deductively generates a comprehensive initiating-event list (terminating at *pinch points*), supported by FMEA reasoning.
- **Event Sequence Diagram (ESD)** — inductive, success-oriented flowchart, one per initiator, mapping paths to end states; communication-friendly, built first.
- **Event Tree (ET)** — the quantitative tree whose mutually exclusive paths are scenarios; the conventional "down" branch is failure.
- **Fault Tree (FT)** — deductive decomposition of a top event (the Boolean *complement* of a system success criterion) through AND/OR gates to basic events. Shared basic events across pivotal-event fault trees are how conditional dependencies are captured.
- **Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs)** — the irreducible joint-failure combinations; the target of Boolean reduction and the basis for quantification. Prevent every MCS, and prevent each MCS by defeating any one member.

### Two Layers of Uncertainty
**Aleatory** = irreducible stochastic variability of observables (the "model of the world"). **Epistemic** = reducible limit of knowledge about parameters and assumptions. They are kept separate. Epistemic uncertainty is moved by **Bayesian updating** (prior + likelihood → posterior) and propagated to the risk metric, typically by sampling. Results are a *fan of percentile curves*, not a single line — the width of the fan is the epistemic uncertainty.

### Bayesian Estimation as the Default Engine
Parameters (failure rates, demand probabilities, initiator frequencies, HEPs, software conditional probabilities) are estimated by fitting a prior and updating with evidence through a likelihood matched to the data-generating process: **Poisson** for time-based counts, **Binomial** for demand-based counts, **lognormal** for handbook/expert values. **Conjugate pairs** (Gamma–Poisson, Beta–Binomial) give closed-form posteriors; mismatches need numerical or MCMC solutions. Sequential updates compound (today's posterior is tomorrow's prior) and are order-independent.

### Dependence: Common-Cause Failure
Ignoring positive dependence underestimates risk. A CCF needs a **root cause** plus a **coupling factor** (shared design, hardware, function, people, procedures, location, environment). Treatment is two-phase: conservative qualitative + quantitative screening, then detailed analysis with **common-cause basic events (CCBEs)** expanded into the fault trees and parameters from the recommended **Alpha Factor** model (beta-factor and Basic Parameter are simpler precursors). The trick is to make the dependence an explicit basic event, after which ordinary independent-event math applies.

### Humans and Software as First-Class Contributors
**HRA** turns human-system interactions into basic events with **human error probabilities** and uncertainty bounds, via a five-step process and method selection (THERP, CREAM, NARA, SPAR-H; time-critical actions via a Time Response Curve). **Software risk is design risk** — compliant code responding wrongly to an unanticipated condition. The **Context-based Software Risk Model (CSRM)** splits software failure into unconditional/routine (failure-rate-quantifiable) and conditional/triggered (failure-on-demand-quantifiable) contributions, marks each recoverable or critical, and risk-informs testing.

### Physics-Governed Branch Points
Many branch outcomes are set by physics, not random failures. The unifying device is the **stress-strength formulation**: the probability that capability exceeds demand, both random variables, via a **limit-state function** (failure when g ≤ 0). Solve analytically for normal/lognormal cases, otherwise by Monte Carlo / LHS / AIS / FORM / SORM / AMV. Range-safety models (inert debris, blast, ray-focusing, plume) translate accidents into public consequence, judged by **Casualty Expectation** against EWR 127-1.

### Results, Importance, and the Safety Case
Uncertainty is propagated (LHS preferred over crude Monte Carlo) with a convergence procedure. **Importance measures** rank what drives the risk: F-V/RRW (where improvement pays off), Birnbaum (sensitivity), RAW (worst-case failure), DIM (parameters, additive). Because complex-system risk cannot be *proven*, credibility rests on completeness, scrutability, peer review, and a **Risk-Informed Safety Case** of evidence plus operating commitments.

### The Graded Approach
Match modeling depth to the stakes and life-cycle phase. Start parametric and coarse with honest uncertainty ranges; add fidelity only where existing models become insufficient or where uncertainty exposes a risk-driving design weakness. A coarse model with honest uncertainty beats a detailed one built on placeholder data.

## Scope & Limits
This skill covers the *Probabilistic Risk Assessment Procedures Guide for NASA Managers and Practitioners* (NASA/SP-2011-3421, Second Edition, December 2011), a US Government public-domain work. It is the **quantitative** counterpart to NASA's risk doctrine: it supplies the scenario logic, data-and-Bayesian estimation, uncertainty and dependence modeling, human and software risk, physics-based models, and abort modeling that put defensible, uncertainty-bearing numbers on risk. It is a *guide of recommended procedures*, not an exhaustive textbook, so individual methods (fault-tree construction, Bayesian inference, CCF) are pointed to companion references — the *Fault Tree Handbook with Aerospace Applications* (2002), *Bayesian Inference for NASA Risk and Reliability Analysis* (NASA/SP-2009-569), NUREG/CR-4780 (CCF), the *NASA System Safety Handbook* (NASA/SP-2010-580), and the *NASA Risk Management Handbook* (NASA/SP-2011-3422, the **nasa-risk** pack). It does **not** cover the qualitative RIDM/CRM decision and governance framework in depth (see nasa-risk), programme-management or organisational-risk requirements, or non-aerospace regulatory contexts; its examples are space-flight-centric (launch vehicles, crewed missions, range safety, lunar/planetary missions) and anchored to the 2011 second edition.
