description: "Knowledge base synthesized from the Guide to the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK) v2.14 by the BKCASE Project. Use for the established systems-engineering canon: SE fundamentals and foundations (systems science, systems thinking, the systems approach, modelling/MBSE), the life cycle (ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288/24748/24774 process, development & agile approaches, model selection/tailoring), technical management, concept definition, architecture/realization (the Vee), V&V, maintenance/sustainment, SE standards, and the application contexts (product, service, enterprise, systems-of-systems, healthcare), plus enabling SE (business/team/individual), related disciplines, quality attributes/specialty engineering, implementation examples, and emerging knowledge. Good for grounding background, vocabulary, and prior-art positions across all eight SEBoK Parts. SCOPE LIMITS: this pack is SEBoK v2.14 only (released 2026-05-18); it synthesizes and signposts rather than reproducing the source — it does not reproduce ISO/IEC/IEEE standard text, is a curated guide (not a complete textbook), and is thin on AI-integration depth (Part 8 is a staging area, not settled practice). LICENCE: content is CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 — non-commercial use only, attribution to the BKCASE Project required, share-alike obligations carry forward."

# SEBoK — Guide to the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (v2.14)
**Source**: BKCASE Project, Trustees of the Stevens Institute of Technology | **Licence**: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 (non-commercial) | **Chapters**: 36

## How to Use This Skill
- **Without arguments** — load the Core Frameworks below: what the SEBoK is, the eight Parts, the foundations stack (systems science → systems thinking → systems approach), the life-cycle/process spine, and the application contexts.
- **With a topic** — ask about a concept (e.g. "emergence", "engineered system context"), a process (e.g. "architecture definition", "tailoring", "maintenance"), an application context (product/service/enterprise/SoS/healthcare), or a standard (15288, 24748, 24774).
- **With a SEBoK Part or chapter** — Part 1 → ch01; Foundations (Part 2) → ch02–ch07; SE & Management (Part 3) → ch08–ch19; Applications (Part 4) → ch20–ch25; Enabling SE (Part 5) → ch26–ch28; Related Disciplines (Part 6) → ch29–ch34; Examples (Part 7) → ch35; Emerging (Part 8) → ch36.

Supporting files: `glossary.md`, `patterns.md`, `cheatsheet.md`.

**Prerequisites:** none — plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or runtime licence tier needed.

> **A guide, not the body of knowledge.** The SEBoK *curates, structures, and signposts* published SE knowledge — it discusses key ideas briefly and points to the references that treat them in depth. This pack mirrors that: synthesized reference notes, not a substitute for the primary sources or the standards themselves.

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### What the SEBoK is
A community-owned, semi-annually updated *guide to* the SE body of knowledge, organized into **eight Parts**. Its primary scope is the **engineered system (ES)** — a technical or socio-technical system that is the subject of an SE life cycle — viewed within its **engineered-system context** (the related engineered, social, and natural systems and environments). SE itself is defined (INCOSE 2023) as a transdisciplinary, integrative approach enabling the realization, use, and retirement of engineered systems. The economic case is empirical (COCOMO II rework data, COSYSMO, NASA overrun correlation), and "how much SE is enough" is a risk-balance between under- and over-investment.

### The eight Parts (the structural backbone)
1. **Introduction** · 2. **Foundations of SE** · 3. **SE and Management** · 4. **Applications of SE** · 5. **Enabling SE** · 6. **Related Disciplines** · 7. **Implementation Examples** · 8. **Emerging Knowledge**. Parts 2–6 are domain-independent; domain specificity enters via Part 7 examples and Part 4 domain KAs.

### Foundations stack (Part 2)
A layered scaffold from the general to the specific, and three grades of knowledge — **concept** (mental building block) → **principle** (a generalization usable for reasoning/action) → **heuristic** (works in practice; "why" not yet explained).
- **Systems science** — general principles and recurring patterns (isomorphies) common to systems of every kind (Bertalanffy, Boulding, Ashby, Beer, Forrester, Simon); the theoretical grounding.
- **Systems thinking** — the integrating paradigm: concepts, principles, patterns, balancing **holism** (the whole, because of emergence) against **reductionism** (the parts, because pure holism can't be acted on).
- **Representing systems with models / MBSE** — a model abstracts selected aspects (function, structure, behaviour, performance, cost); MBSE formalizes models across the life cycle and is a subset of digital engineering.
- **Systems approach applied to engineered systems** — a whole-system, whole-life-cycle, whole-stakeholder problem-solving framework (Hitchins' "Seven Samurai" of interacting systems; narrower vs. wider system-of-interest).

The two hardest properties — **complexity** and **emergence** — are precisely what create the need for systems thinking.

### Life-cycle & process spine (Part 3)
- **Life cycle** = the evolution of an entity from conception to retirement (24748-1); a **life cycle model** is a staged framework, selected and adapted per project, never inherited rigidly. A **stage** is bounded by milestones/**decision gates**; **technical reviews & audits** check state against criteria.
- **Development approaches**: sequential / incremental / evolutionary, with **agile** overlapping. **Agile in SE** = sense, respond, evolve across the whole life cycle ("being agile", per 24748-10), realized practically through Industrial DevOps.
- **Processes** are described uniformly (**24774**), selected from **15288**, and **tailored** with **24748-2** — applied with **concurrency, iteration, recursion**, not serially.
- **Technical Management (SEM)**: planning, assessment & control, decision management (trade studies, MODA), requirements management, risk, configuration, information, quality, measurement — distinguished from general project management by its technical focus.
- **Concept Definition** (problem space first): Business/Mission Analysis + Stakeholder Needs Definition → an integrated set of needs and Measures of Effectiveness, before System Definition.
- **Architecture → Realization → Deployment**: Architecture Definition sets functional/logical/physical views; realization runs down-and-up the **Vee** with **V&V performed concurrently and recursively** level by level.
- **Maintenance & sustainment**: planned from acquisition (15288 Cl. 6.4.1/6.4.9), run concurrently with operations; sustainment spans the long operational life (twelve product-support elements, LORA, RCM, life-cycle cost).
- **SE standards**: **ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288** is the trunk; take a full-life-cycle approach to any standard (evaluate → select → adapt → assess → improve).

### Application contexts (Part 4) — overlapping, not exclusive
- **Product SE** — end product *plus* enabling products; SE and market development run together (NPDP).
- **Service SE** — engineering a value co-creation chain with the customer as participant; services can't be inventoried.
- **Enterprise SE** — the enterprise viewed *as a system* where **people are components**, not just users.
- **Systems of Systems** — constituents are operationally and managerially independent (**Maier**); you **compose** via interfaces, you don't command.
- **Healthcare SE** — a domain extension layered over the others (devices ≈ Product SE; delivery ≈ Service SE; public health ≈ structural failure).

### Enabling, disciplines, attributes, examples, emerging (Parts 5–8)
- **Enabling SE** at three levels — business/enterprise (PDCA loop), team (capability + dynamics, IPTs, Tuckman), individual (roles + **KSAA** competency; competency ≠ performance).
- **Related disciplines** — SE's bounded overlaps with software engineering (neither a subset of the other), project management (no standard split; PMP/SEMP), industrial engineering, the physical/domain disciplines, environmental & geospatial engineering.
- **Quality attributes / specialty engineering** — the interdependent "-ilities"; engineer them together, and where they share a concern with **loss**, use a Loss-Driven view.
- **Implementation examples** — the evidence locker (GPS, Hubble vs. FBI VCF, Therac-25 …), each mapped back to the canon.
- **Emerging knowledge** — a staging area; the connective thread is transformation toward model-based, theory-grounded, AI-entangled SE (SE4AI / AI4SE).

## Scope & Limits

**Covers**: the established systems-engineering canon across all eight SEBoK Parts (v2.14) — foundations (systems science, systems thinking, the systems approach, modelling/MBSE); the life cycle and its processes (15288/24748/24774, development & agile approaches, model selection and tailoring); technical management; concept definition; architecture, realization, V&V (the Vee), and deployment; maintenance and sustainment; SE standards; the five application contexts (product, service, enterprise, systems-of-systems, healthcare); enabling SE at business/team/individual levels; related disciplines; quality attributes / specialty engineering; implementation examples; and emerging knowledge. Good for grounding background, vocabulary, and prior-art positions.

**Does not cover (or is thin on)**: it does **not reproduce** the ISO/IEC/IEEE standard text it references (15288, 12207, 24748, 24774 are named and described, not quoted — see `se-standards-signpost`); it is a **curated guide**, not a complete textbook, and signposts primary sources rather than replacing them; AI-integration depth is limited (Part 8 / ch36 is an emerging-topics staging area, not settled practice — for AI governance use `nist-ai-rmf` / `eu-ai-act`); and detailed security engineering, test & evaluation, and digital-engineering implementation live in companion packs (`nist-sse`, `dod-te-guidebook`/`faa-ams-vv`, `dod-digital-engineering`/`digital-systems-engineering`).

**Source version**: SEBoK **v2.14**, released 2026-05-18 (supersedes the prior v2.13 build). One chapter per SEBoK Knowledge Area or tightly-coherent KA group.

**Licence & attribution**: the SEBoK is published under **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0)**, so this pack's content carries the same licence — **non-commercial use only**, **attribution to the BKCASE Project (Trustees of the Stevens Institute of Technology) required**, and **share-alike**: derivatives must be distributed under the same licence.
