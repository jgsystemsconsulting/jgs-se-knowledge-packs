# NASA NPR 7123.1D — Systems Engineering Processes and Requirements
**Source**: NASA (US Government work, public domain) | **Chapters**: 9

## When to use
Use this skill when you need to apply, explain, or assess NASA's mandatory systems engineering process framework: the 17 common technical processes (SE Engine), life-cycle and technical review requirements, SEMP planning obligations, TRL assessments, tailoring vs. customizing decisions, or contracted project SE governance. This is the normative SE process standard for all NASA programs and projects; it pairs with NASA/SP-6105 (the non-mandatory SE Handbook) for implementation guidance.

**Prerequisites:** none — plain Markdown; no MCP server, API key, or licence tier needed at runtime.

## How to Use This Skill
- **Without arguments** — load the core frameworks below for an overview of the SE Engine, SEMP, and review system.
- **With a topic** — ask about specific processes (e.g., "logical decomposition", "product validation"), review types (e.g., "PDR entrance criteria"), TRL levels, tailoring rules, or MOE/MOP/TPM distinctions.
- **With a chapter** — ask for `ch03` (17 processes), `ch05` (reviews), `ch06` (SEMP), `ch08` (TRLs), `ch09` (review criteria).

## Core Frameworks & Mental Models

### The SE Engine — 17 Common Technical Processes

The SE Engine is the NASA model for systems engineering. It applies recursively to every product layer in the system structure throughout all life-cycle phases. Three process groups work together:

**System Design Processes (top-down, SE-07 to SE-10)**
1. **Stakeholder Expectations Definition** — elicit ConOps, use cases, MOEs; validate expectations.
2. **Technical Requirements Definition** — transform expectations into unique, quantitative, verifiable "shall" statements; define MOPs and TPMs.
3. **Logical Decomposition** — decompose requirements by function/behaviour/time; produce functional models and derived requirements for lower levels.
4. **Design Solution Definition** — translate logical models into preferred design alternatives satisfying derived requirements; produce end-product specifications.

**Product Realization Processes (bottom-up, SE-11 to SE-15)**
5. **Product Implementation** — make, buy, or reuse the lowest-level end product.
6. **Product Integration** — assemble verified lower-level products into the next higher-level product.
7. **Product Verification** — prove conformance to specifications ("built it right?").
8. **Product Validation** — prove the product satisfies stakeholder expectations in its intended environment ("right thing built?").
9. **Product Transition** — deliver the verified/validated end product to the next customer in the system structure.

**Technical Management Processes (cross-cutting, SE-16 to SE-23)**
10. **Technical Planning** — plan the technical effort; outputs the SEMP.
11. **Requirements Management** — maintain bidirectional traceability; manage requirement changes over the life cycle.
12. **Interface Management** — establish and control interface definitions across teams, contractors, and geographies.
13. **Technical Risk Management** — make risk-informed decisions; manage risk across health/medical, safety, technical, cost, and schedule dimensions.
14. **Configuration Management** — control configuration items; maintain integrity, traceability, and security throughout the life cycle.
15. **Technical Data Management** — capture and manage trade studies, analyses, reports, and technical data across the life cycle.
16. **Technical Assessment** — monitor technical progress; feed life-cycle reviews.
17. **Decision Analysis** — apply formal criteria, alternatives analysis, and selection to significant technical decisions.

### SEMP — The Living Technical Plan

The Systems Engineering Management Plan (SEMP) is the master technical planning document. Key rules:
- Established early in Formulation; updated through SIR; reapproved by ETA and program manager at each major review.
- Must describe how all 17 processes are recursively applied across every product layer and life-cycle phase.
- All technical discipline plans (integration, V&V, HSI) must be consistent with the SEMP.
- ETA must approve the SEMP (SE-06) — this is a binding "shall" requirement.
- For small projects, SEMP content may be incorporated into the Project Plan with ETA approval.

### Tailoring vs. Customizing

| | Tailoring | Customizing |
|---|---|---|
| **What it adjusts** | What must be done (NPR requirements) | How requirements are implemented |
| **Relief mechanism** | Waiver (post-config-control) or Deviation (pre-config-control) | None needed |
| **ETA approval** | Required | Not required (but document in SEMP) |
| **Compliance matrix** | Entry required | Entry recommended |

### Measurement Cascade: MOE → MOP → TPM → Leading Indicator

- **MOE** (Measure of Effectiveness): Qualitative stakeholder-facing validation criterion; defined in Stakeholder Expectations Definition. Drives validation.
- **MOP** (Measure of Performance): Quantitative design target; two or more per MOE; defined in Technical Requirements Definition. Drives design.
- **TPM** (Technical Performance Measure): Monitored subset of MOPs tracked against plan throughout the life cycle. Drives progress tracking.
- **Leading Indicators**: Forward-looking subset of TPMs (mass margins, power margins are mandated). Drives early corrective action.

### Life-Cycle Review System

Reviews are event-based (triggered by technical maturity, not calendar). Each review requires:
1. Entrance criteria satisfied before convening.
2. Mandatory SE work products at specified maturity levels (Initial → Preliminary → Baseline → Update).
3. Review complete only when: all RIDs/RFAs dispositioned with TA concurrence, board report distributed, decision memo signed by Decision Authority.

Key mandatory products timeline:
- **MCR**: Baselined stakeholder expectations, concept definition, approved MOEs
- **SRR**: Baselined SEMP, baselined requirements, baselined HSI approach
- **PDR**: Preliminary design solution, baselined integration plans, baselined V&V Plan *(new in 7123.1D)*
- **CDR**: Baseline detailed design
- **FRR**: Baseline V&V results, final certification for flight/use

### TRL Scale Summary

| TRL | Environment | Fidelity |
|---|---|---|
| 1–3 | Laboratory | Principles, concept, proof-of-concept |
| 4–5 | Lab → Relevant | Breadboard (4), Brassboard (5) |
| 6 | Relevant environment | Full-scale prototype |
| 7 | Operational environment | Engineering unit or prototype |
| 8 | Operational environment | Final configuration, flight-qualified |
| 9 | Actual mission | Flight-proven |

TRL must be assessed in Formulation and updated at every status review. Other maturity scales must map back to TRL.

### ETA (Engineering Technical Authority)

- Independently funded from programme budgets — the structural check-and-balance.
- Approves: SEMP, waivers, deviations, key technical documents.
- Cannot approve relief from non-technical Programmatic Authority requirements.
- Raises formal dissenting opinions through the dissent process (NPR 7120.5).
