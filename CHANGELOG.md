[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.7.0] — 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`nasa-rm-standard`** (6 ch) — NASA Reliability and Maintainability Standard
  (NASA-STD-8729.1A, Rev A, 2017): NASA's objectives-driven R&M framework — the R&M objectives
  hierarchy (one Top Objective decomposed into four sub-objectives, paired with tailorable
  strategies), how R&M requirements are established inside the SMA Plan required by NPR 7120.5,
  the SMA Technical Authority concurrence/independent-evaluation governance, milestone vs.
  readiness review gates, the reliability/maintainability/availability vocabulary (Ai vs. Ao,
  the failure causal chain, risk as a triplet), and the R&M Evidentiary Methods catalogue
  (FMEA/FMECA, FTA, RBDA, RCM, LORA, plus the space-environment and parts-pedigree analyses).
  An objectives-and-strategies standard — defers step-by-step procedures to the referenced
  NASA Preferred Reliability Practices. Tier 1 (US-gov public domain).
- **`dod-rio`** (8 ch) — DoD Risk, Issue, and Opportunity (RIO) Management Guide for Defense
  Acquisition Programs (OUSD R&E, Sep 2023 incl. Change 2.2): the defense-acquisition mechanics
  of program risk management — the RIO definitions, the five-step risk process
  (plan-identify-analyze-mitigate-monitor), 1–5 likelihood/consequence scoring and the 5×5 risk
  matrix, the four mitigation options (accept/avoid/transfer/control), burn-down plans, issue
  management (probability=1), opportunity management toward should-cost, cross-program/interface
  risk, tailoring RIO to the six AAF pathways (UCA/MTA/MCA/Software/DBS/Services), specialized
  methods (RMF, MBCRA/Cyber Table Top, Agile metrics, FMECA, ITRA/DTRAM), and institutionalizing
  RIO via the PRMP, boards (RMB/JRMB/ROMB/RWG), tiered roles, and WBS/IMP/IMS/EVM/TPM integration.
  The DoD-acquisition complement to `nasa-risk` and `dau-se-guidebook`; names third-party policy
  material (EIA-748, MIL-STD-881F, DCMA metrics) without reproducing it. Tier 1 (US-gov public
  domain, Distribution A).
- **`dod-digital-engineering`** (7 ch) — DoD Digital Engineering Strategy (2018, OUSD/ODASD(SE)):
  the Department of Defense's five digital engineering goals — (1) formalize the development,
  integration, and use of models; (2) provide an enduring authoritative source of truth;
  (3) incorporate technological innovation; (4) establish supporting infrastructure and
  environments; (5) transform the culture and workforce — plus their focus areas, the
  document-to-model and design-build-test→model-analyze-build shifts, model formalisms/provenance,
  governance and access control of the authoritative source of truth, and the
  coordinate→plan→pilot→sustain rollout. A vision-and-policy strategy, deliberately
  non-prescriptive (no how-to method or MBSE/SysML mechanics); excludes the CAC-gated Digital
  Engineering Body of Knowledge (DEBoK). Tier 1 (US-gov public domain, Distribution A).

Catalogue now 27 packs (+2 signposts).

  practices it inside the Acquisition Management System (AMS) and the National Airspace System —
  the five-phase AMS lifecycle and its five decision points, operational concept development and
  implementation-free functional analysis (ConOps, FFBD/N², CMLs), requirements and architecture
  synthesis (PRS→MRS, the pPRD→iPRD→fPRD ratchet, RAM, CPRs), the seven technical management
  disciplines (Integrated Technical Management/SEMP, Interface Management/IRD-ICD, Risk-Issue-
  Opportunity, Configuration Management, SE Information Management, Decision Analysis, V&V), and the
  specialty disciplines (RMA via Service Threads, Life Cycle Engineering, E3/Spectrum, Human
  Factors, Information Security via the NIST RMF, System Safety via the SMS, environmental/EOSH).

  schedule management of aerospace and large engineering efforts — the five sub-functions (Planning,
  Development, Assessment & Analysis, Maintenance & Control, Documentation & Communication), the
  Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) and WBS/OBS/CBS, the Schedule Management Plan (SMP) and Basis of
  Estimate, Critical Path Method, float and margin, tiered schedule assessment (the Shock Test, the
  Dimensions of Schedule Reliability), Schedule Risk Analysis (SRA), Integrated Cost-Schedule Risk
  Analysis (ICSRA), Monte Carlo and the Joint Confidence Level (JCL), baselining vs. replan vs.
  rebaseline, and EVM schedule metrics (SPI, BEI, CEI, Earned Schedule, CPLI). Grounded in NPR
  7120.5 and the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide. Tier 1 (US-gov public domain).
- **`dod-mosa`** (7 ch) — *Implementing a Modular Open Systems Approach in DoD Programs* (OUSD R&E,
  Feb 2025): MOSA as a DoD acquisition + design discipline — the statutory/regulatory basis
  (10 U.S.C. 4401–4403, FY2017/FY2021 NDAA, DFARS), the five OUSD(R&E) pillars, the
  plan→modularize→identify→define→standardize interface lifecycle, technical levers (WBS/
  MIL-STD-881F taxonomy, standards profiling, API-first software, COTS/cybersecurity), MOSA
  assessment metrics and tools (PART/OAAT/KOSS/SEAM/MAUT), technology-change and DMSMS management,
  roadmaps, MOSA across the six AAF pathways, and contracting/IP/data-rights mechanics. Names
  third-party standards (FACE, OMS, DISR) without reproducing them. Tier 1 (US-gov public domain,
  Distribution A).

Catalogue now 24 packs (+2 signposts).

## [1.5.0] — 2026-06-23

### Added

- **`nasa-pra`** (8 ch) — NASA Probabilistic Risk Assessment Procedures Guide (NASA/SP-2011-3421,
  2nd ed., 2011): the quantitative PRA engine — the risk triplet and scenario logic stack (MLD,
  ESD, event trees, fault trees, minimal cut sets), Bayesian data collection and parameter
  estimation, aleatory/epistemic uncertainty and common-cause failure (Alpha Factor, beta-factor,
  CCBE), human reliability analysis (THERP, CREAM, NARA, SPAR-H), context-based software risk
  (CSRM), physics-based/structural models (stress-strength, FORM/SORM, NASGRO), uncertainty
  propagation and importance measures (F-V, RAW, Birnbaum, DIM), and launch-abort modeling with

  qualitative RIDM/CRM framework in `nasa-risk`. Tier 1 (US-gov public domain).
- **`nasa-se-expanded`** (6 ch) — Expanded Guidance for NASA Systems Engineering
  (NASA/SP-2016-6105-SUPPL, Vol 1, March 2016): the practitioner-depth supplement to the NASA SE
  Handbook — the SE Engine's per-phase cadence and iterative-vs-recursive distinction, life-cycle
  tailoring vs. customization and the Compliance Matrix, the recursive system-design consistency
  loop (ConOps, requirement flow/type/ownership), product realization (verify/qualify/accept/
  certify cardinality, protoflight, 'test the way we fly'), and crosscutting technical management
  (six-step scheduling, cost estimating, JCL, interface document family, RIDM/CRM, CM baselines,

Catalogue now **16 live packs (+2 signposts)**.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **`omg-signpost`** — a *signpost*, not a knowledge pack: zero OMG content, just spec names,
  purposes, and the OMG download URL. OMG specs are Excluded (licence forbids packaging), so
  this points users to OMG instead. New `kind: signpost` marker; `check_release.py` exempts
  signposts from the link ban and pack-structure checks.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

  conformity assessment, GPAI models, transparency, governance, and Annex III. EU Official
  Journal (reproduction authorised with source acknowledgement).
- Both were deferred in v1.1.0 (automated source download blocked); built from user-supplied,
  title-verified PDFs. Catalogue now 13 live packs.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Nine new packs**, all Tier-1 public-domain or Tier-2 open:
  - `nasa-npr-7123` (NASA SE process requirements), `nasa-risk` (Risk Management Handbook),
    `nasa-system-safety` (System Safety Handbook v2), `nasa-hsi` (Human Systems Integration).
  - `nist-ai-rmf` (AI Risk Management Framework 1.0), `nist-ssdf` (SP 800-218), `nist-csf` (CSF 2.0).
  - `mil-std-882` (DoD System Safety).
  - `requirements-writing` (original guidance: EARS patterns + requirement quality, CC BY 4.0 —
    cites methods rather than reproducing ISO 29148 / the EARS paper).
- `docs/PACK-BACKLOG.md` source ledger; `docs/SOURCE-VETTING.md` Excluded list extended
  (OMG `formal/` corpus, NAF, DAU). `eu-ai-act` and `dodaf` deferred (source download blocked).

### Removed

- **`omg-sysml`** pack — pulled from the catalogue. The OMG Specification License public grant
  permits only informational, unmodified, non-network-posted use ("will not be copied or posted
  on any network computer" and "no modifications are made to this specification"), so a hosted,
  transformed knowledge pack is not redistributable. OMG `formal/` specifications (UML, SysML,
  BPMN, UAF, …) are now on the Excluded list (`docs/SOURCE-VETTING.md`), confirmed by two
  independent licence reads. (Shipped in error in v1.0.0; that tag was private and never published.)
